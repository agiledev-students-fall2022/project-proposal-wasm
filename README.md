### Project title

interative simulations

### What and why?

an online game or virtual reality that can support multiple users</br>
through building this application, aim to gain a better understanding of unix/linux networking interface, protocols, and rendering algorithms

### For whom?

for people like me, this app can have an entertaining or training aspect</br>
for example, if this software turn out to be a flight simulation, it can be training software for pilots

### How?

a description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective</br>
each user's data will be stored, so data is not lost after the user exits the browser. database can be used to store per user information
the user should see an interface that they can navigate to play different parts of the game
simulation can be done using webgl or opengl
compute intensive part can be written as functions in c, then compile it into webassembly, call the function from js

### Scope

if difficulty become too big, the game can be reduced to a simpler version
