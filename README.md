### Project title

interative simulation application on browser

### What and why?

an online game or virtual reality that can support multiple users</br>
through building this application, aim to gain a better understanding of unix/linux networking interface, protocols, and rendering algorithms

### For whom?

for people like me, this app can have an entertaining or training aspect</br>
for example, if this software turns out to be a flight simulation, it can be training software for pilots</br>
if it includes simulations of natural phenomena, it can be used for scientific simulation or physics experimentation</br>

### How?

a description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective</br>
each user's data will be stored, so data is not lost after the user exits the browser. database can be used to store per user information</br>
the user should see an interface that they can navigate to play different parts of the game</br>
mern stack will be used, and simulation can be done using webgl or opengl</br>
compute intensive part can be written as functions in c, then compile it into webassembly (e.g., emscripten), call the function from js</br>

### Scope

if difficulty become too big, the game can be reduced to a simpler version
